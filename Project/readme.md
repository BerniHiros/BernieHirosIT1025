## Executive Summary
I will research the history and future of Markdown.  What Markdown is and where and how we can use this language. I will detail how to learn Markdown and submit a sample.

### Project or Co-op

## Conclusion
I have enjoyed the course and its exposure to so many new thoughts.  I try and research (on the side) when I feel behind. I am in awe of some of the younger students knowledge. I am registered for IT 1050 with Khaizaran, Dalia.  I would like to know the most employable IT degrees. Then take more courses and decide a path.
