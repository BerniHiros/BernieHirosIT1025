## Executive Summary
### Software
Operating software: Operating System Software is software that manages the computer’s hardware (hides its complexity), and acts as an interface with application programs. 
Examples: Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, Google's Android OS, Apple macOS, Linux Operating System.

Application software: a single or group of programs designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the for an end user. (End User = person who ultimately use the product). 
Examples: MS Word, WordPad and Notepad. /Internet browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. /Microsoft Power Point, Keynotes. /Auto CAD. /MySQL, Oracle, MS Access. /Apple Numbers, Microsoft Excel. /Real Player, Media Player.

Utility Software: Utility software makes the computer run better. It will analyze and maintain a computer by focusing on how the OS works. Some examples below include how they protect, manage, compress, clean and speed up your computer.
* Antivirus: Windows Defender, AVG, AVAST, MCAFEE
* File management: File Manager in Windows.
* Compression: WinAce, WinZip, WinRAR,7-Zip, PKZIP,
* Disc management: Mini Tool Partition Wizard, Paragon Partition Manager, SMART Monitoring Tools, AOMEI Partition Assistant
* Disc cleanup: Iolo System mechanic, Piriform Cleaner, Razer Cortex
* Disc defragmenter: MyDefrag,  Perfect disk, Deflaggler

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The software for ERP will differ for each company.  Our small business would not need what a multi-national conglomerate would need. Basically, what is needed of a computer for the company to function to their best. Examples: Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, NetSuite, Sage Intact, SAP Business ByDesign.

Virtualization – The purpose is: to create a virtual version of multiple OS in one storage device or network resource. The three ways to create virtual servers are: full virtualization, para-virtualization and OS-level virtualization. The physical server is called the host. Example, VMware running on an x86 computer is a virtual environment.

Cloud computing is the delivery of shared computing resources, software or data, as a service and on-demand through the internet. The difference being virtualization can be independent of the internet; the information is contained on a machine.

### Virtualization

Virtualization allows a company to instantly access limitless computing resources quickly. The most important function is the capability of running multiple operating systems and applications on a single computer or server. Businesses benefit by reduced hardware costs, faster servers, improved disaster recovery, significant energy costs savings and, increased productivity.

Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources (server) from the virtual environments. The role of the hypervisors is to take physical resources and divide them for use in a virtual environment. Hypervisors can either sit on top of an operating system or be directly installed into the hardware.  The latter being more prevalent 

Cloud Computing is an on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources (ex* networks, servers, storage, and applications) that can be easily released with minimal effort or service provider using the internet. Virtualization is a software that creates separate multiple images on the same machine. This makes possible to install multiple OS, multiple software and multiple applications on the same physical machine.  Virtualization (the software) for cheaper data center setup. In comparison to the Cloud which is good for public use (internet).

Virtualization is technology that separates functions from hardware into virtual environments. Both the intranet & internet are both established, a network administrator can take the information and send it elsewhere through the cloud. A VMware network administrator can build and install computer infrastructure, to encompasses hardware, servers, and virtual machines, using a VMware environment.  They create user accounts, controlling access to networks, and managing storage and security settings.

#### Python
Pseudocode is a way to execute commands which enables the programmer to plan without worrying about syntax. Example = Python when we added two numbers together.  We used regular vocabulary with simple phrases. 

Interpreted language v.s. Compiled language.  Interpreted language is a single instruction read one line at a time on input. The translation occurs at the same time as the program is being executed. Compiled language will input an entire program at the onset, because a compiler has translated the code language up front, before the program is even run.  Assembly is a mix of both.
* Examples: Interpreter = Python, Java, Ruby
* Examples: Compiler = C+, go, Swift
* Examples: Assembly = x86, mips, arm


#### Career Exploration
##### College Central
College Central – I like working in the educational atmosphere and hope to work at Tri-C west while finishing computer courses. [https://www.tri-c.edu/administrative-departments/human-resources/careers.html]. I will use the events and programs listed on College Central after I have finished more courses. I certainly need interview help.

##### Certifications
Each certification pathway has many levels.  I am not sure of which computer pathway I am interested yet. I will be looking into the most employable of the choices

CompTIA - CompTIA IT Fundamentals and CompTIA A+ = A fundamental course if offered prior to the skills needed in A+
Cisco- CENT and the CCT certifications serve as starting points for a career as a networking professional in Cisco
CISSP - SSCP are more security related pathways. 

##### Certificates 
Tri-C offers numerous certificates that can be completed in six months to one year. Some examples in the Information Technology Department include: Cisco, Computer Maintenance, Data Analytics and Cybersecurity. I am looking for computer classes that cross over until I choose a pathway.  Having finished the Polysomnography Certificate, I can attest that you are ready to be placed into a position after training. Tri-C offers certificates in many different fields which can be found at [https://www.tri-c.edu/programs/programs-a-z.html].

##### Co-ops / Internships
A Co-op is usually a full-time paid position alternating with coursework at a college. An internship may or may not be paid and can be part-time. Both have many benefits; I believe the most important is getting to "try out" what you may choose as a career.  This may affect your going forward or choosing a different career path. Secondly, after completing a co-op/internship a student has real work experience that today’s employers are looking for. They also have a leg up on other applicants especially at the present company where they have already been trained. 
Tri-C had asimple one page online form to fill out electronically. Added benefit for students, in addition to being compensated (financially or experience) a student can earn one college credit for every 180 hours worked (up to three credits per semester).
