##Executive Summary##
###Software###
Operating software: Operating System Software is software the manages the computer’s hardware (hides its complexity), and acts as an interface with application programs. 
Examples: Microsoft Windows, Apple iOS, Google's Android OS, Apple macOS, Linux Operating System.

Application software: a single or group of programs designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the for an end user. (End User = person who ultimately use the product). 
Examples: MS Word, WordPad and Notepad. /Internet browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. /Microsoft Power Point, Keynotes. /Auto CAD. /MySQL, Oracle, MS Access. /Apple Numbers, Microsoft Excel. /Real Player, Media Player.

Utility Software: Utility software makes the computer run better. They analyze and maintain a computer by focusing on how the OS works. Some examples below include how they protect, manage, compress, clean and speed up your computer.
Antivirus: Windows Defender, AVG, AVAST, MCAFEE
File management: File Manager in Windows.
Compression: WinAce, WinZip, WinRAR,7-Zip, PKZIP,
Disc management: Mini Tool Partition Wizard, Paragon Partition Manager, SMART Monitoring Tools, AOMEI Partition Assistant
Disc cleanup: Iolo System mechanic, Piriform Cleaner, Razer Cortex
Disc defragmenter: MyDefrag,  Perfect disk, Deflaggler

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): The software for ERP will differ for each company.  Our small business would not need what a multi-national conglomerate would need. Basically, what is needed of a computer for the company to function to their best. Some examples would be  Dynamics 365 for Finance and Operations, NetSuite, Sage Intact, SAP Business ByDesign.

Virtualization – Creating a virtual version, computer hardware platform, storage device, network resource. The three ways to create virtual servers are: full virtualization, para-virtualization and OS-level virtualization. The physical server is called the host. Example, VMware running on an x86 computer is a virtual environment.

Cloud computing is the delivery of shared computing resources, software or data, as a service and on-demand through the internet. Virtualization can be independent of the internet; the information is contained on a machine.

###Virtualization###

	Virtualization allows a company to instantly access limitless computing resources quickly. The most important function is the capability of running multiple operating systems and applications on a single computer or server. Businesses benefit by reduced hardware costs, faster servers, improved disaster recovery, significant energy costs savings and, increased productivity.

Software called hypervisors separate the physical resources (server) from the virtual environments. The role of the hypervisors is to take physical resources and divide them for use in a virtual environment. Hypervisors can either sit on top of an operating system or be directly installed into the hardware.  The latter being more prevalent 

Cloud Computing is an on-demand network access to a shared pool of computing resources (ex* networks, servers, storage, and applications) that can be easily released with minimal effort or service provider using the internet. Virtualization is a software that creates separate multiple images on the same machine. This makes possible to install multiple OS, multiple software and multiple applications on the same physical machine.  Virtualization (the software) for cheaper data center setup. In comparison to the Cloud which is good for public use (internet).

Virtualization is technology that separates functions from hardware into virtual environments. Both the intranet & internet are both established, a network administrator can take the information and send it elsewhere through the cloud. A VMware network administrator can build and install computer infrastructure, to encompasses hardware, servers, and virtual machines, using a VMware environment.  They create user accounts, controlling access to networks, and managing storage and security settings.
