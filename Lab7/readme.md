### File Compression

A zip file is used for a single file or groups of files.  The file(s) are organized and compressed making the total file smaller and easier to send.  The data is compressed by the computer, kind of like a cipher, giving codes to frequently used letters = making the files smaller.

Uses for a zip file would include large documents or photos for decreasing the size.  Organization purposes a file holding multiple files that are sent as one zip file can be sent quicker and opened together.
