## Executive Summary

### File Compression

A zip file is used for a single file or groups of files.  The file(s) are organized and compressed making the total file smaller and easier to send.  The data is compressed by the computer, kind of like a cipher, giving codes to frequently used letters = making the files smaller.

Uses for a zip file would include large documents or photos for decreasing the size.  Organization purposes a file holding multiple files that are sent as one zip file can be sent quicker and opened together.

JPEG is a raster image format and uses lossy compression algorithm and image may lost some of its data. JPEG file sizes grow quickly for large files such as images. You should not save and re-save the same jpg file multiple times because the quality of the image will degrade more and more each time you save it.
SVG is a text-based image format and uses mathematical structures to represent an image and is highly scalable. SVG is a vector image format, renders well at any size. Format is highly compressible and lightweight

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Class = would be fast food = Class is a template from which objects are created.  Class is a group of similar objects.
Object = would be the individual fries & burger.  Object is an instance of a class. A class is a person , place or thing.

*object - sammy - Object are person, place, or thing.
*class - shark -  group of similar items called classes.
*inheritance - a specific type of shark - giving out most essential details.
*abstraction - swim(self) - includes property of another class.
*encapsulation - definition of a shark  - means hiding the code and data.
