## Executive Summary

### Internet Architecture
#### Internet Protocol

IP (internet protocol) = address for your computers or a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet.  How computers find each other and how the source of information is located, host or network identification and location addressing

Ipv4 v.s. Ipv6 – Like all thing technology related, the growth is exponential.  The need for more AP addresses also grows exponentially.

An IPv4 address consists of four numbers, each of which contains one to three digits, with a single dot (.) separating each number or set of digits. Each of the four numbers can range from 0 to 255. IPv4 supports a maximum of approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses. 

An IPv6 address consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits. If a group consists of four zeros, the notation can be shortened using a colon to replace the zeros. IPv6 supports a presently thought unending number of unique IP addresses. 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.

ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) - is a community driven governing board that oversees IP addresses. The private non-profit corporation has responsibility for IP addresses, protocol parameter assignment, domain name system management, and root server system functions.

#### TCP/IP

TCP/IP allows one computer to talk to another computer through a world wide, fault tolerant network, via the Internet by compiling packets of data and sending them to right address.

The article compares transmission to a phone.  Someone initiates the connection by dialing the phone, at the other end of the connection someone else then picks up the line. The main difference is that the data is sent across your network. To go a little more in depth the data is broken into data packets that networks can deliver.  Packets from the network layer are reassembled and then a retransmission is sent that all reassembled packets have arrived.

The advantage of splitting the task into different layers is that any of the layers can be changed without affecting the other layers. Delivery can happen even if there are differnet computer systems involved.

TCP/IP application layer  
•	Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, HTTP 
•	File Transfer Protocol, FTP  
•	Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP 
•	Domain Name System, DNS  
•	TELNET 
•	Simple Network Management Protocol, SNMP   

The OSI application layer 
•	Layer 7 - Application
•	Layer 6 - Presentation
•	Layer 5 - Session
•	Layer 4 - Transport
•	Layer 3 - Network
•	Layer 2 - Data Link
•	Layer 1 - Physical

#### Internet Security

HTTP – signifies all the information is being sent in clear text.  The client and server can easily read the information. Easily readable form, however, should not contain any sensitive data because the information is not safe.

The protocol that is used to signify secure data is designated by the letter “S” at the end of HTTPS.  Personal info, passwords or payments should have the “S” following HTTP.  A padlock symbol may also to the left of the address.

#### Securing your Web Browser

Securing your web browser is important to protect your computer from  problems caused from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer.  

Being guilty of just hitting the allow cookies button while shopping the internet – I chose to investigate this risk. In the past past when I banned all browser cookies some websites were difficult to navigate. However, after setting controls I can now help protect my privacy while shopping.

### Internet Programming
#### World Wide Web Consortium

 In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, to facilitate technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to lead the Web to its full potential

Semantics (or word meanings) In every language across the world, words may have different meanings for the same object or thought. Jargon for different professions are also thrown into the mix.  Now we have computers that are crossing all these boundaries. The term “Semantic Web” refers to W3C’s vision of the Web of linked data. Semantic Web technologies enable people to create data stores on the Web, build vocabularies, and write rules for handling data.
Within the Semantic Web, _vocabularies_ are used to classify the terms that can be used in a application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice, vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or very simple (describing one or two concepts).

#### HTML5 and CSS
 HTML is meant to tell the Browser what data you want on a page, CSS is meant to tell the Browser how those things should look. HTML is for information and CSS can make it look nicer.
 
 My web Page I am a fan of quotes.  A daily uplifting quote can go a long way. I followed the instruciona sn did not wat to deviate to much for the assingmnent. 

#### HTML and XML
XML – eXtensible Markup Language. The most basic components of an XML document are elements, attributes, and comments. Both human and machine readable XLM was designed to transport data.

XML tags are extensible whereas HTML has limited tags.
XML tags are not predefined whereas HTML has predefined tags.
XML store and transfer the data whereas HTML is used for the data presentation. 
XML is the standard markup language to define other languages v.s. HTML is a simple, predefined language. 

Components of a URL

* scheme = https
* domain = www.amazon.com
* top level domain = .edu
* default page = no file path provided
* parameters = result of search
* anchor =  specific location on a page
