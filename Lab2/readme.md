## Executive Summary
I will explain the hardware componenets of a computer and what effects its speed. Shomw examples of the language of a computer (binary) and conversions to decimal and hexidecimal.

###Hardware
###Hard Drives and Memory
###Hard Drive Latency  (Delay)

Hard drive latency refers to the total amount of time it takes to send an entire message, over a link between sender and receiver.  The article further breaks it down to include seek time or time taken to find data on the disc. Time is measured in milliseconds which may not seem like much however to large companies this can be detrimental. There are three factors that contribute to latency; propagation delay, routing and switching, and queuing and buffering.

###SSD v.s. HDD

Hard disk drive (HDD) has been around for a number of years. The main benefit of the older HDD is the price.  The price for capacity is presently cheaper than the solid state drive (SSD).  The newer SSD has many benefits; speed, longevity, durability and noise. The average speed of a SSD is two â€“ three times faster than HDD (as seen in this video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j84eEjP-RL4.  Although the longevity of the HDD presently is a bit longer than that of SSD, the performance of the older HDD decreases with age. Durability hands down goes to SSD as there are no moving parts. The HDD is almost like a miniature electromagnetic record player in a box.  Lots of moving parts that need both electricity and magnets to run properly. Lastly vibrations cause the moving parts of the HDD to make noise.  Whereas the SSD can withstand vibrations up to 2000HZ.

###Random Access Memory Explained

Increasing the RAM makes the computer run faster. Program information or data starts in the hard drive. The data then is loaded into the RAM where the CPU can access the data.  If your computer has a large amount of RAM this process goes seamlessly from one area directly to the next.  However, if your computer does not have enough RAM to run your large programs some of the data stays on the hard drive to be later recalled as needed.

The difference between 64 and 32 bit data pathways refers to the number of bits of data transferred in a clock cycle. Having such a CPU today that runs on a 32 bit is unlikely. Intel started making 32-bit processors in the 80386 range way back in 1985; it was selling 64-bit processors by 2001. The main difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform.  This then will affect the speed at which they can complete tasks.
