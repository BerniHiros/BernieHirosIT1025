## Executive Summary
I will explain the hardware componenets of a computer and what effects its speed. Convert examples of Binary the language of a computer  and conversions to decimal and hexidecimal.

## Hardware
### Hard Drives and Memory
#### Hard Drive Latency  (Delay)

Hard drive latency refers to the total amount of time it takes to send an entire message, over a link between sender and receiver.  The article further breaks it down to include seek time or time taken to find data on the disc. Time is measured in milliseconds which may not seem like much however to large companies this can be detrimental. There are three factors that contribute to latency; propagation delay, routing and switching, and queuing and buffering.

#### SSD v.s. HDD

Hard disk drive (HDD) has been around for a number of years. The main benefit of the older HDD is the price.  The price for capacity is presently cheaper than the solid state drive (SSD).  The newer SSD has many benefits; speed, longevity, durability and noise. The average speed of a SSD is two – three times faster than HDD (as seen in this video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j84eEjP-RL4.  Although the longevity of the HDD presently is a bit longer than that of SSD, the performance of the older HDD decreases with age. Durability hands down goes to SSD as there are no moving parts. The HDD is almost like a miniature electromagnetic record player in a box.  Lots of moving parts that need both electricity and magnets to run properly. Lastly vibrations cause the moving parts of the HDD to make noise.  Whereas the SSD can withstand vibrations up to 2000HZ.

#### Random Access Memory Explained

Increasing the RAM makes the computer run faster. Program information or data starts in the hard drive. The data then is loaded into the RAM where the CPU can access the data.  If your computer has a large amount of RAM this process goes seamlessly from one area directly to the next.  However, if your computer does not have enough RAM to run your large programs some of the data stays on the hard drive to be later recalled as needed.

The difference between 64 and 32 bit data pathways refers to the number of bits of data transferred in a clock cycle. Having such a CPU today that runs on a 32 bit is unlikely. Intel started making 32-bit processors in the 80386 range way back in 1985; it was selling 64-bit processors by 2001. The main difference between 32-bit processors and 64-bit processors is the number of calculations per second they can perform.  This then will affect the speed at which they can complete tasks. 

#### ALU and the Control Unit

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is used by the computer to operate basic instructions. RAM send instructions to the Control Unit (CU) which decodes the instructions. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) will sort calculations and compare jobs inside the computer. The type of operation is sent to the ALU which choses (or not) to perform a temporary operation. If your data has information to output, it will leave the ALU through a register. The registers are then loaded onto a bus.   

   
### Hardware: ALU and the Control Unit

I am going to the store to buy four Chobani Greek yogurts that are on sale. My yogurt containers are connected to the self-checkout system through information accessed when scanning the UPC on the container. This code holds information about the cost of the yogurt in order to charge me correctly and contains an approximate weight for use when bagging. I scan the yogurts bar code and the information (RAM) is sent to the CPU.  The CPU then sends the items cost and weight to the ALU.  The ALU temporarily holds the information. The weight of each container is immediately sent for bagging purposes. The sale adjusted cost is held until the ALU is told to total up my purchases for the final bill. 

### Logic Gates and Circuits

Hardware: Logic Gates and Circuits. 
Digital logic circuits use voltage to represent the “1 & 0” of binary code. Truth tables show the outcome when each pair (group) is either on or off. Below are samples NAND & AND gate -  2 input truth tables.  The gate is how the currents run and the outcome [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty5FklXcHVE].

### IEEE

IEEE’s Hardware Standard
	The Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or IEEE, started as electricity became common. The purpose of this group was to help people of a trade apply their skills for the betterment of society. Some of the original members include the man who upgraded the lightbulb, Thomas Edison, representing electricity. Alexander Graham Bell, the creator of the Telephone, representing the Telephone Industry, and Norvin Green Representing Telegraphy (The Telegraph). Today it is the world’s largest technical professional society, that serve other professionals in all areas of technology.  Some of the general principles they follow are stated in the three pillars. 
Ethically Aligned Design – Three Pillars
Universal Human Values – Good of all people and the environment.  Guide to policy makers and creators.
Political Self-Determination – Freedom and safety of people (& their data identity).
Technical Dependability – Trust, reliability and safety of products.  Meet device objectives and be explainable.


### Data Representation: Numeric Conversions

Base ten system is what we learned to count on our fingers and toes at a young age. Also known as the decimal system, it uses the decimal point to separate whole numbers from decimal fractions. The base ten system consisting of 10 digits to show all numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 using place value.

Binary, the prefix gives you a hint of a two coefficient.  Utilizes only the numbers “0 and 1”.  These are the recognized digits for computers O = off and 1 = on.  The value of each place is twice the value of the previous place.  (ex* 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128) To evaluate a binary number’s decimal equivalent, multiply each number by its place value and add all the results together.

Hexadecimal is a simpler way for human operators to utilize binary.  A single place value in hexadecimal represents four bits of memory. When you double that two places represents eight bits, or one byte. Hence, you’ll see hexadecimal used to represent the value of memory registers. The bit sizing makes it easier to read than a string of ones and zeros.

### Hexadecimal Color Representation

#ff016b Color Conversion
The color vivd pink must be converted to computer language and sent to the printer to tell it the color needed. [https://www.colorhexa.com/ff016b]. The hexadecimal color #ff016b has RGB values of R:255, G:1, B:107 and CMYK values of C:0, M:1, Y:0.58, K:0. Its decimal value is 16712043. When using colors to day the color wheel is still a good basis for complementary colors for providing contrast.  Computers also use the RGB color model which use combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a computer monitor or television screen. The vidid pink color would use a complementary color such as vivid cyan (hex #01ff95) to be best offset.
