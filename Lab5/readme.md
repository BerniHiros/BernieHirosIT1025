##Executive Summary


### Lucidchart

Is a cloud based software that can be used across different operating systems. You can even create, update, and share your flowchart for free. I used the tutorials and tried different colors and outlines. I will use other sites [https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/10-lucidchart-features-to-increase-productivity], when we make our next chart. 

### Introduction to Networking
#### Data Transmission
* Packet - Unit of data 
* Packet-switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
* IP address - Unique identifying number 
* DSN - Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
* Protocol -Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

IP address is a number assigned to a router and the DSN is like the phone book that maintains a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP).

DNS Domain Name Servers are a set of standards within the protocol for how computers exchange data on the internet and on many private networks. 

Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity in digital telecommunication networks.  Decreasing the latency for the packets (units of data) in communication exchange.

#### Networking Hardware
A hub is considered non-intelligent in handling data packets, simply the information comes in and goes out to all connections. A switch is preferred over a hub because it is considered intelligent as it can differentiate where the data packet is sent, thus decreasing network traffic.

Both Hub and switches can only be used in a LAN (local network).  To send information over the internet a router is needed to read IP addresses to send information. A router is a gateway to other networks.

#### Network Topologies
Single point of failure = part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. Examples; Start ring, bus (term or point). 

Infrastructure topololgy is only used in LAN (local networks), the extra cabling needed makes this expensive. In comparison, and example of wireless mesh is the internet. Information can more quickly in many types of networks without the extensive amount of cabling between all devices.
