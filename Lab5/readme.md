##Executive Summary


### Lucidchart

Is a cloud based software that can be used across different operating systems. You can even create, update, and share your flowchart for free. I used the tutorials and tried different colors and outlines. I will use other sites [https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/10-lucidchart-features-to-increase-productivity], when we make our next chart. 

### Introduction to Networking
#### Data Transmission
* Packet - Unit of data 
* Packet-switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address 
* IP address - Unique identifying number 
* DSN - Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com
* Protocol -Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

IP address is a number assigned to a router and the DSN is like the phone book that maintains a directory of domain names and translate them to Internet Protocol (IP).

DNS Domain Name Servers are a set of standards within the protocol for how computers exchange data on the internet and on many private networks. 

Packet switching is used to optimize the use of the channel capacity in digital telecommunication networks.  Decreasing the latency for the packets (units of data) in communication exchange.

#### Network Hardware
A hub is considered non-intelligent in handling data packets, simply the information comes in and goes out to all connections. A switch is preferred over a hub because it is considered intelligent as it can differentiate where the data packet is sent, thus decreasing network traffic.

Both Hub and switches can only be used in a LAN (local network).  To send information over the internet a router is needed to read IP addresses to send information. A router is a gateway to other networks.

#### Network Topologies
Single point of failure = part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. Examples; Start ring, bus (term or point). 

Infrastructure topololgy is only used in LAN (local networks), the extra cabling needed makes this expensive. In comparison an example of wireless mesh is the internet. Information can more quickly in many types of networks without the extensive amount of cabling between all devices. 

#### Network Design
A Small business owner (techincally husband), I tried to emulate our office. We only have three main computers. A firewall is installed prior to reaching the switch.  Each person has multiple devices for the field. 

#### NSA/CSS
About Us 
_Mission & Values_ - The National Security Agency/Central Security Service (NSA/CSS)  encompasses both signals intelligence (SIGINT) and information assurance (now referred to as cybersecurity) products and services, and enables computer network operations (CNO) in order to gain a decision advantage for the Nation and our allies under all circumstances.

_Central Security Service_ -The Central Security Service (CSS) provides cryptologic support, knowledge, and assistance to the military cryptologic community.

_Cryptologic Centers_ - Headquaters in Maryland, ** NSA/CSS Colorado ,NSA/CSS Georgia, NSA/CSS Hawaii, NSA/CSS Texas **

_Cryptologic Heritage_ - Through the Center for Cryptologic History, the National Cryptologic Museum, and the NSA/CSS Cryptologic Memorial, NSA/CSS shares with the public-at-large some of the contributions cryptologists have made to the defense of our Nation

_NSA Advisory Board (NSAAB)_ - NSA receives advice from the nation's experts and informs the National Security Agency Advisory Board (NSAAB), which has been in existence in one form or another since 1953.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption

#### Information Systems Security
Choosing Amazon.com online chat has use of all three portions of the traid model.   Amazon is a company that runs 24/7 and need to be aware of all threats.  Online chat can help customers ask questions.  My job at Amazon would include:

Integrity – Send a text check when a password is being accessed from a different IP or delivery is going to a new address.  Prevention of disclosure attacks, leakage, and theft Integrity

Accessibility - Provide reliable, timely access to data when required.  Sales is the base of the company and it is important to keep the customers happy.

Confidentiality - Data are trustworthy, coherent, and modified only by authorized principles. Not selling personal information, however they do keep very good track of what you view to purchase.

Basic authentication is important because it enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users to access protected resources. This may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services. A Multi-factor authentication is an authentication method in which a computer user is granted access after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence: knowledge, possession, and inherence. Two-factor authentication is a type, or subset, of multi-factor authentication

1.	Credit card is asked for verification, when we are out of town.  Usually just a code sent to our phones

2.	Bank Account sometimes will ask us to update passwords and verify a security question.

3.	Pay Pal – has in the past also asked for verification when one of my kids used the account to make an out of country purchase (I was with them).

Below are some examples:
•	Codes generated by smartphone apps
•	Badges, USB devices, or other physical devices
•	Soft tokens, certificates
•	Fingerprints
•	Codes sent to an email address
•	Facial recognition
•	Retina or iris scanning
•	Behavioral analysis
•	Risk score
•	Answers to personal security questions

ACL – access control list is best suited on the individual level.  Users are assigned to certain objects within the company.

RBAC – role based access control is used in a larger company where levels of access may differ.  Users are assigned roles and privileges.

Cipher text is the written code. Words encrypted from plain text and later decrypted by the receiver back to plain text.  
Public key is held by all, hence the term public and is used to encrypt plain text
Private key is held only by the person needing to decrypt code back to plain text.

A public key is needed for a wide distrubution. Larger amounts of data can be encrypted quickly. Allowing the cipher text to reach multiple users. Whom have the private key to decrypt.

#### Cryptography


#### Brute-Force
