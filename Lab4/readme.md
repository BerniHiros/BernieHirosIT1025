## Exutive Summary
In this lab I will show examples using the command line to create a new directory and adding new Files.   Returning to Python we will get a better understanding and run a program. Lastly, I will create a graphic using Vectr while understanding pixels and compressions.


### Python IDLE

Python shell uses interactive mode to evaluate single commands. It utilizes read, evaluate and print.  However, you cannot go back. There is no menu bar.
IDLE = integrated development environment (IDE) provided by Python. This allows the novice programmer to use Python effectively with the use of a tool bar. The menu allow you to change, save and run a program that has multiple lines.

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Vector graphics uses mathematical instruction to form an image.  The display is good at any scale.  There are distinct continuous clean lines in the image. Conversion from a scan is not required.  Some of the more popular formats are; AL, EPS, SVG & PDF.   [http://neatdesigns.net/16-nice-examples-of-vector-graphics/].  Vector images are better for transparency and clear words for an image

Raster graphics are composed of pixels (little squares) 8 x 8 in a 64 grid pattern.  When size is enlarged edges can be distorted and square edges can be seen. Formats may include JPG, GIF, PNG and TIFF. Bitmap graphics are better when using photography and its software programs.


### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

When developers use lossy compression some of the image is left out and cannot be restored to its original image.  Lossy does have a high data holding capacity that uses estimates to represent the content.  Lossless when increasing the size, the image does not lose quality. This is preferred for high quality images.  However, lossless does have a lower data capacity.

### File Formats

JPG - Joint Photo Expert Group - is commonly used for digital photos without high contrast.  Often used for screenshots, movies and games. A JPG file is a simple graphic image with larger file sizes.

GIF – Graphic Interchange Format - is commonly used for an animated raster graphics file. It is the second most common image format used on the World Wide Web after JPEG.  Used in line drawings, simple graphics.

PNG – Portable Network Graphic - is commonly used for high contrast digital photos. PNG files are used to store web graphics and images with transparent backgrounds. Contains a bitmap of indexed colors and is compressed with lossless compression also has larger file sizes.

### File Properties

Our company hired Go Daddy to design and maintain its webpage. I decided to see if I could create an interesting graphic to load.  I used a similar font to our company logo and added a graphic I felt relevant.  My Vectr upload (5 lines) included on image and four lines of text two are layered. I used shadowing and rounded corners from tutorial video.  Properties are ; size 904 KB and it opens with svg file path.  On my home computer I presently don’t have Nikon program or photo shop.  Chrome svg file is the best due to the photo.


## Conclusion
I found this lab challenging because of working ahead. I made a second directory names images instead of a sub-folder.  I enjoy using Python if you use the correct format it works.  If you don’t use the correct wording (string), you will get an error.  I am thinking of exploring graphic art a little more after this lab.  The world of graphics is vast, a cartoon drawing to a detailed photo, layers of typography or just creative font use.  I will investigate the job prospects in this field more.
