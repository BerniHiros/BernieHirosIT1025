### Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Vector graphics uses mathematical instruction to form an image.  The display is good at any scale.  There are distinct continuous clean lines in the image. Conversion from a scan is not required.  Some of the more popular formats are; AL, EPS, SVG & PDF.   [http://neatdesigns.net/16-nice-examples-of-vector-graphics/].  Vector images are better for transparency and clear words for an image

Raster graphics are composed of pixels (little squares) 8 x 8 in a 64 grid pattern.  When size is enlarged edges can be distorted and square edges can be seen. Formats may include JPG, GIF, PNG and TIFF. Bitmap graphics are better when using photography and its software programs.


### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

When developers use lossy compression some of the image is left out and cannot be restored to its original image.  Lossy does have a high data holding capacity that uses estimates to represent the content.  Lossless when increasing the size, the image does not lose quality. This is preferred for high quality images.  However, lossless does have a lower data capacity.

### File Formats

JPG - Joint Photo Expert Group - is commonly used for digital photos without high contrast.  Often used for screenshots, movies and games. A JPG file is a simple graphic image with larger file sizes.

GIF – Graphic Interchange Format - is commonly used for an animated raster graphics file. It is the second most common image format used on the World Wide Web after JPEG.  Used in line drawings, simple graphics.

PNG – Portable Network Graphic - is commonly used for high contrast digital photos. PNG files are used to store web graphics and images with transparent backgrounds. Contains a bitmap of indexed colors and is compressed with lossless compression also has larger file sizes.
