**Executive Summary**

The purpose of Lab 1 is threefold. First is a quick intoduction to the history of computers. The largest part is creating a GitHub account in which to store upcoming labs/projects and becoming familiar with the program. Next is utalizing screen capture (snipping tool), which will be used in many upcoming labs. Lastly adding this readme.md file.  Markdown in this portion is the most challenging. I have printed out the markdown cheatsheet and watched you tube videos to no avail.


**Information System Components**

The smart watch is becoming very popular across all age groups. The hardware would be the watch itself and often either a phone, tablet, laptop or home computer. Theses watches differ in their abilities often in direct proportion with the price tag. The software usually lies in one of two camps either apple watch or android fitbit/samsung galaxy (many more are appearing on the market). Mobile app software is directly related to the watch, the best app is chosen by the consumer. Data input can vary from weight loss tracking, to sleep cycle monitoring, even desired miles or steps moved. Higher end watches are small wrist computers that can send and receive email. The people portion starts from the watch owner, to a help desk representative for set up, also the team that created the device, finally the owners of the company.  The watch companies can follow the process of their product as each watch owner signs into their account to ether track their progress, update files or email.  This has led to many improvements and updates.


**GitHub**

Client - Server Architecture - Servers are those that distribute the application. The server host shares their resources application to the client. The client can be termed a service requester. The client must understand the protocol of the data requested. To communicate properly they must both be using a common language. Some examples of computer applications that use the clientâ€“server model are Email and the world wide web.


**Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources without buying, owning or maintaining a physical data center (hardware). Companies often use the cloud for many reasons; data backup, disaster recovery, software development/testing and data analytics.  GitHub is an open-source cloud-based server. It is available to download for free.  Shown on the tractor video GitHub is client friendly and easy to share ideas in real time across the world. After researching the top 10 examples of cloud computing, I use quite a few; Netflix, Microsoft 360, Alexa, Siri, Dropbox, Facebook and a in need of update LinkedIn account.


**Conclusion**

I enjoy the challenge of using GitHub. Prior to this course I would have considered myself computer competent.  I now realize even if I can master Microsoft does not make one computer savvy.  I hope to understand Markdown language.  I would like to learn more about Haroopad or other helpful resources. I like the layout of the Lab and its clear directions.  Look forward to learning about more directions I may wish to follow in computers
