_<h5>Executive Summary_

The purpose of Lab 1 is threefold. First, a quick introduction to the history of computers. The largest portion is creating a GitHub account in which to store upcoming information and becoming familiar with the program. Next is utilizing screen capture (snipping tool), which will be used in many upcoming labs. Lastly, adding this readme.md file.  Markdown has posed the greatest challenging. I have printed out the markdown cheat sheet and watched you tube videos to no avail.


**Information System Components**

The smart watch is becoming popular across all age groups. The hardware would be the watch itself and either a phone, tablet, laptop or home computer. These watches differ in their abilities in direct proportion with the price tag. The software usually lies in one of two camps either apple watch or android fitbit/samsung galaxy (more watch choices appearing on the market). Mobile app software is directly related to the watch, the best app is chosen by the consumer. Data input can vary from weight loss tracking, to sleep cycle monitoring, even desired miles or steps moved. Higher end watches are small wrist computers that can send and receive email. The people portion starts from the watch owner, to a help desk representative for set up, also the team that created the device, finally the owners of the company.  The watch companies can follow the process of their product as each watch owner signs into their account to either track their progress or update files and email.  This has led to many improvements and updates.


**GitHub**

**Client - Server Architecture**

Servers are those that distribute the application. The server host shares their resource application to the client. The client can be termed a "service requester". The client must understand the protocol of the data requested. To communicate properly they must both be using a common language. Some examples of computer applications that use the clientâ€“server model are Email and the world wide web.

**Cloud Computing**

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources without buying, owning or maintaining a physical data center (hardware). Companies often use the cloud for many reasons; data backup, disaster recovery, software development/testing and data analytics.  GitHub is an open-source cloud-based server. It is available to download for free.  Shown on the tractor video, GitHub is client friendly and easy to share ideas in real time across the world. After researching the top 10 examples of cloud computing, I use quite a few; Netflix, Microsoft 360, Alexa, Siri, Dropbox, Facebook and a in need of update LinkedIn account.


**Conclusion**

I enjoy the challenge of using GitHub. Prior to this course I would have considered myself computer competent.  I now realize even if I master Microsoft, this does not make one computer savvy.  I hope to better understand Markdown language.  I would like to learn more about Haroopad or other helpful resources. I like the layout of the Lab and its clear directions.  Looking forward to learning about more directions I may wish to follow in computers
